Description
-----------
FilterCodes filter for Moodle enables content creators to easily customize
and personalize site and course content using plain text tags.

In addition, it also enables you to:
* Inserting non-breaking spaces;
* Tagging text as being in a different language;

Usage of the {FilterCodes} tags requires no knowledge of HTML but might be
important for sites wishing to comply with accessibility requirements.

IMPORTANT: Although we expect everything to work, this ALPHA release has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](http://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues).

Requirements
------------
This plugin requires Moodle 3.1+ from http://moodle.org/

Changes
-------
The first public ALPHA version was released on 2017-07-07.

For more information on releases since then, see CHANGELOG.md.

IMPORANT: Although we expect everything to work, this ALPHA release has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](http://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues).

There are no configurable settings for this plugin at this time.

{FilterCodes} are meant to be entered as regular text in the Moodle WYSIWYG editor through they will work equally well if entered in the code view.

Moodle metadata filters

* {firstname} : Display the user's first name.
* {surname} : Display the user's surname (family/last name).
* {fullname} : Display the user's first name and surname.
* {alternatename} : Display the user's alternate name. If blank, will display user's first name instead.
* {city} : Display the user's city.
* {country} : Display the user's country.
* {email} : Display the user's email address.
* {username} : Display the user's username.

Conditionally display content filters

* {ifenrolled}{/ifenrolled} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user **is** enrolled in the current course.
* {ifnotenrolled}{/ifnotenrolled} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is **not** enrolled in the current course.
* {ifloggedin}{/ifloggedin} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged in as non-guest.
* {ifloggedout}{/ifloggedout} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged out or is loggedin as guest.
* {ifguest}{/ifguest} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as guest.
* {ifstudent}{/ifstudent} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in and enrolled in the course (no other roles).
* {ifassistant}{/ifassistant} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as a non-editing teacher in the current course.
* {ifminassistant}{/ifminassistant} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as a non-editing teacher or above in the current course.
* {ifteacher}{/ifteacher} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as a teacher in the current course.
* {ifminteacher}{/ifminteacher} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as a teacher or above in the current course.
* {ifcreator}{/ifcreator} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as a course creator.
* {ifmincreator}{/ifmincreator} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as a course creator or above.
* {ifmanager}{/ifmanager} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as a manager.
* {ifminmanager}{/ifminmanager} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as a manager or above.
* {ifadmin}{/ifadmin} : Will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as an administrator.

If the condition is not met in the particular context, the specified tag and it's content will be removed.

HTML and "lang" tagging

* {nbsp} : Is substituted for a non-breaking space when displayed.
* {langx xx}{/langx} : Tag specific text in a particular language by wrapping the text in a plain text pair of {langx xx} {/langx} tags. This makes no visible changes to the content but wraps the content in an HTML <span lang="xx"></span> inline tag. As a result, screen readers will make use of this information to use a particular kind of pronunciation if the text is in a different language than the language of the rest of the page. This is required for compliance with W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)

The opening {langx xx} tag should also include two [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code abbreviation letters in lowercase associated with language's name. French, for example, has the code **fr**:

    {langx fr}Contenu{/langx}

The {langx fr}{/langx} filter will convert this into the following HTML

    <span lang="fr">Contenu</span>

Security considerations
-----------------------
There are no known security issues at this time.

Motivation for this plugin
--------------------------
The development of this plugin was motivated through our own experience in Moodle development and topics discussed in the Moodle forums. The project is sponsored and supported by TNG Consulting Inc.

Limitations
-----------
* The {langx xx}{/langx} tag only supports inline text, not blocks of text.
* Unpredictable results may occur if you interweave HTML code with {FilterCodes} tags.

Incorrect example:

    <strong>{FilterCode}Content</strong>{/FilterCode}

Correct example:

    {FilterCode}<strong>Content</strong>{/FilterCode}

Future Releases
---------------
Features that we are considering adding to future releases include:
* Finish unit testing script.
* Add ability to access additional information from profile fields.
* Add ability to access information in custom profile fields.
* Add ability to insert profile picture.
* Add ability to access course meta information. Example, teacher's name.
* Add ability to list courses in the current course's category.
* Add ability to list subcategories of the current category.
* Add ability to define custom code blocks - useful for creating global content blocks that can be centrally updated.
* Add the ability for {langx xx}{/langx} tag to supports blocks of text (using DIV), not just inline text (using SPAN).
* Option to disable unused or unwanted filters in order to optimize performance.
* Create an Atto add-on to make it easier to insert FilterCodes tags.

Let us know what is important to you and if you have any other suggestions.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------
IMPORANT: Although we expect everything to work, this ALPHA release has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](http://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues).

**Question: {FilterCodes} Tags are displayed as entered**

Answer: Here are a few things you can check:
* Make sure the plugin is enabled. See installation instructions.
* If the tag is in a heading, make sure you have enabled the plugin for both content and headings.
* For the {langx} tag, make sure you included the 2 letter language code in the opening tag. The closing tag must not contain any language code.
* If the tags required a closing tag, make sure that it includes a forward slash. Example: {/ifenrolled}.
* Try a different tag like {protocol}. If it still doesn't get replaced with http or https either, chances are that this part of Moodle doesn't support filters yet. Please report the part of Moodle that doesn't support filters in the Moodle Tracker. If the problem is with a 3rd party plugin, please report the issue to the developer of that plugin using the Bug Tracker link on the plugin's page on moodle.org/plugins.

**Question: Can I nest tags? For example, {ifloggedin}{ifenrolled}Message to appear if enrolled and loggedin.{/ifenrolled}{/ifloggedin}**

Answer: Yes. In this case, both conditions must be met for the message to appear.

**Question: How can I use this to pre-populate one or more fields in a Contact Form for Moodle?**

Answer: Just put the tag in the input's value parameter. Here are a couple of examples:

    <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required="required" value="{email}">
    <input id="name" name="name" type="text" required="required" value="{fullname}">

Pro Tip: You can pre-populate a field and make it non-editable for logged-in users using a conditional tag:

    <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required="required" {ifloggedin}readonly{/ifloggedin} value="{email}">
    <input id="name" name="name" type="text" required="required" {ifloggedin}readonly{/ifloggedin} value="{fullname}">

**Question: Why do administrators see the text of all other roles when using {ifminxxxx}Content{/ifminxxxx} tags?**

Answer: This is normal as the administrator has the permission of all other roles. the {ifmin...} tags will display content if the user has a minimum of the specified role or above. For example, {ifminteacher}Content here!{/ifminteacher} will display "Content here!" whether the user is a teacher, course creator, manager or administrator even if they are not a teacher.

**Question: Is there a tag to display...?**

Answer: Only the tags listed in the documentation are currently supported. We are happy to add new functionality in future releases of FilterCodes. Please post all requests in the [Bug Tracker](http://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues). You'll find a link for this on the plugin's page. The subject line should start with "Feature Request: ". Please provide as much detail as possible on what you are trying to accomplish and, if possible, where in Moodle the information would come from. Be sure to check back on your issue as we may have further questions for you.

**Question: How can I test to see if all of the tags are working?**

Answer: Create a Page on your Moodle site and include the following code:
* First name: {firstname}
* Surname: {surname}
* Fullname: {fullname}
* Alternate name: {alternatename}
* City: {city}
* Country: {country}
* Email: {email}
* Username: {username}
* Course or Site name: {coursename}
* User ID: {userid}
* Course ID: {courseid}
* WWWroot: {wwwroot}
* Protocol: {protocol}
* IP Address: {ipaddress}
* Referer: {referer}
* Recaptcha: {recaptcha} (will be available in a future release)
* Non-breaking space: This{nbsp}: Is it! (view source code to see the non-breaking space)
* English: {langx en}Content{/langx}
* Enrolled: {ifenrolled}You are enrolled in this course.{/ifenrolled}
* Not Enrolled: {ifnotenrolled}You are not enrolled in this course.{/ifnotenrolled}
* LoggedIn: {ifloggedin}You are logged-in.{/ifloggedin}
* LoggedOut: {ifloggedout}You are logged-out.{/ifloggedout}
* Guest: {ifguest}You are a guest.{/ifguest}
* Student: {ifstudent}You are student who is logged-in and enrolled in this course and have no other roles.{/ifstudent}
* Non-editing Teacher: {ifassistant}You are an assistant teacher.{/ifassistant}
* Non-editing Teacher (minimum): {ifminassistant}You are an assistant teacher or above.{/ifminassistant}
* Teacher: {ifteacher}You are a teacher.{/ifteacher}
* Teacher (minimum): {ifminteacher}You are a teacher or above.{/ifminteacher}
* Course Creator: {ifcreator}You are a course creator.{/ifcreator}
* Course Creator (minimum): {ifmincreator}You are a course creator or above.{/ifmincreator}
* Manager: {ifmanager}You are a manager.{/ifmanager}
* Manager (minimum): {ifminmanager}You are a manager or administrator.{/ifminmanager}
* Admin: {ifadmin}You are an administrator.{/ifadmin}

You can switch to different roles to see how each will affect the content being displayed.

**Question: When a user is logged out, the First name, Surname, Full Name, Email address and Username are empty. How can I set default values for these tags?**

Answer: You can do this using the language editor built into Moodle. There is currently support for the following defaults: defaultfirstname, defaultsurname, defaultusername, defaultemail. By default, these are blank. As for the Full Name, it is made up of the firstname and surname separated by a space and is therefore not settable.

**Question: Can I use FilterCodes in custom menus?**

Answer: Technically for sure! But only of the theme supports it. If it doesn't, contact the theme's developer and request that they add support for Moodle filters.

**Question: Why is the IP Address listed as 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1?**

Answer: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 is the same as localhost and it means that your web browser is probably on the same computer as your web server. This shouldn't happen with users accessing your Moodle site from their own desktop or mobile device.

**Question: Can I combine conditional tags?**

Answer: Yes. However you can only combine (AND) them so that two or more tags must be true in order for the content to be displayed. For example:

{ifloggedin}{ifenrolled}You are logged-in and enrolled in this course.{/ifenrolled}{/ifloggedin}

This plugin does not support {if this OR that} type conditions at this time. Depending on your requirement, the {ifmin...} tags might help you achieve this. These tags enable you to display content to users with a minimum role level. This could be useful if you wanted to only display a message to faculty such as (teacher or above).

**Question: Why does it show me as enrolled on the front page?**

Answer: The Front Page is a course in Moodle. All users are enrolled by default in this course.

**Question: I have a question that is not listed here**
